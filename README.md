## What is this?
januslinux is a fast and compact [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/) distribution which uses [musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org/). This distribution is made from scratch. Its goal is to be optimized and compact. It uses a package manager called "npkg". It's a fork of [CRUX's](https://crux.nu/) package manager called "pkgutils". januslinux is oriented for general use, but it is designed for advanced Linux users. januslinux was compiled with a hardened toolchain for better security. januslinux is a rolling distribution, it allows you to get the latest software. Also, januslinux have pretty good hardware support.
