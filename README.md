# Ataraxia Linux - Fast and compact Linux distribution which uses musl libc.

## Introduction to the distribution
Ataraxia Linux is a fast and compact [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/) distribution which uses [musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org/). This distribution is made from scratch. Its goal is to be optimized and compact. It uses own fork of package manager called "pkgutils" from [CRUX](https://crux.nu/). Ataraxia Linux is oriented for general use, but it is designed for advanced Linux users. Ataraxia Linux was compiled with a hardened toolchain for better security. Ataraxia Linux is a rolling distribution, it allows you to get the latest software. Also, Ataraxia Linux have pretty good hardware support.

## Introduction to the build system
[Ataraxia Linux](https://github.com/ataraxialinux/ataraxia) is made from scratch. Every package build and configuration file was written from scratch is controlled by the Ataraxia Linux team and it's contributors. To build the Linux distro we have made a build system called "Ataraxia" because it literally means, "unperturbed ness", "imperturbability", "equanimity", or "tranquillity". It's the main purpose to build and port packages easily.

## Supported platforms
Ataraxia Linux has been ported to many CPU architectures. There are about 14 of them:
```
 * x86_64       - for 64-bit x86 CPUs
 * i686         - for 32-bit x86 CPUs beggining at classic Intel Pentium Pro
 * aarch64      - for 64-bit ARM CPUs
 * armv7l       - for 32-bit ARM CPUs beggining at ARMv7-a (hard-float)
 * armv5tel     - for 32-bit ARM CPUs beggining at ARMv5 (soft-float)
 * mips64       - for 64-bit MIPS CPUs beggining at MIPS Release 1 (big-endian)
 * mips64el     - for 64-bit MIPS CPUs beggining at MIPS Release 1 (little-endian)
 * mips         - for 32-bit MIPS CPUs beggining at MIPS Release 1 (big-endian)
 * mipsel       - for 32-bit MIPS CPUs beggining at MIPS Release 1 (little-endian)
 * ppc64le      - for 64-bit PowerPC CPUs (little-endian)
 * ppc64        - for 64-bit PowerPC CPUs (big-endian)
 * ppc          - for 32-bit PowerPC CPUs (big-endian)
 * riscv64      - for 64-bit RISC V CPUs
 * riscv32      - for 32-bit RISC V CPUs
```
 
## Index of source packages
We have separated packages on groups to make build system cleaner. We have following repositories for packages:
```
 * bsp          - Packages for specific board support (eg. Linux kernels, bootloaders, misc. tools)
 * community    - Packages maintained by Ataraxia Linux community. Not supported by core team
 * experimental - Unstable packages mostly for testing new features and adding new packages
 * packages     - Main packages collection for Linux distribution
 * toolchain    - Packages to build cross-toolchain [mostly required to build basic system]
```

## Bootstrapping

### Installing build dependencies
We need specific packages to build this Linux distribution. Without them you can't perform the required tasks. To install required build dependencies:
Debian or Ubuntu (and derivatives):
```
apt-get install build-essential m4 wget gawk bc bison flex texinfo python3 python perl libtool autoconf automake autopoint gperf bsdtar libarchive-dev xorriso curl git mtools liblzma-dev pigz libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev pixz libelf-dev libssl-dev groff
```
Fedora (and derivatives):
```
dnf install libarchive-devel libarchive bsdtar autoconf automake git autoconf automake gawk m4 bison flex texinfo patchutils gcc gcc-c++ libtool gettext-devel xorriso glibc-static perl python3 python2 xz-devel mtools pigz gmp-devel mpfr-devel libmpc-devel pixz openssl-devel elfutils-devel groff
```
Arch Linux (and derivatives):
```
pacman -S base-devel xorriso mtools git pigz python python2 pixz
```
Ataraxia Linux:
```
prt-get depinst libisoburn python python2 mtools pixz
```

### Getting source code
We're using git as control system. You need git to download source code:
```
git clone https://github.com/ataraxialinux/ataraxia
```
If you want to switch to specific version:
```
git checkout [Ataraxia Linux version]
```

### Building
As already mentioned we use build system called "janus" to build Ataraxia Linux. We have several build sections called "stages":
```
 * 0          - This stage intended to compile cross-toolchain
 * 1          - This stage intended to compile basic target system with cross-compiler (you don't need to compile stage 0)
 * 1a         - If you have failure while building it you can always continue task
 * 1-embedded - This stage intended to compile small embedded system with cross-compiler (you don't need to compile stage 0)
 * 2          - This stage intended to generate .iso, hard disk and stage images
 * 2-embedded - This stage intended to generate hard disk and stage images for embedded devices
 * all        - Just do 0, 1 and 2 stages automatically

```
To run build process (as root):
```
BARCH=[supported architecture] ./build stage [stage number]
```
And magic happens!

## Conclusion
So this document describes Ataraxia Linux build system, how to use it. Thanks for attention!
