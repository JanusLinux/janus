Subject: [BUG] ELL doesn't have a fallback for rawmemchr

Hi!

Building ELL 0.35 on a musl system fails, due to ell/pem.c using
rawmemchr(), which is a glibc extension. Building IWD with internal
ELL fails for the same reason.

I see that IWD itself has src/missing.h with a fallback, but ELL lacks
that.

We are using the following patch to fix the build:

diff --git a/ell/pem.c b/ell/pem.c
index 790f2c2..237ae02 100644
--- a/ell/pem.c
+++ b/ell/pem.c
@@ -224,7 +224,7 @@ static uint8_t *pem_load_buffer(const void *buf, size_t=
 buf_len,

 		/* Check that each header line has a key and a colon */
 		while (start < end) {
-			const char *lf = rawmemchr(start, '\n');
+			const char *lf = memchr(start, '\n', end - start);
 			const char *colon = memchr(start, ':', lf - start);

 			if (!colon)

If ELL is willing to include a src/missing.h of their own, that would
solve the issue, but avoiding rawmemchr() completely is also a
possibility.

Thanks,
